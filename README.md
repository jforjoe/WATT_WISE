# WATT_WISE___Energy-Monitoring
WATT WISE
The project is about building a device that can monitor as well possibly control the energy consumption of various devices in offices and industries in real-time.

The device gets the reading from the diverse devices or sensors by [[Receiving (Communication)]] in real-time and using [[Data-Processing]] we take care of all the missing, corrupted or improper-formatted data before sending it to the [[Cloud]] using an [[Transmission (Communication)]].

The above processes will be taken care using a [[Microprocessor]]. This enclosed device is a mini mediator to collect process and send the data to the [[Cloud]] platform.

The Ai integration into the monitoring system will help optimizing energy consumption. In these contexts, energy expenditure is a major cost factor and a significant contributor to environmental pollution. The project addresses the challenge of limited visibility and control over energy use, often necessitating manual interventions with conventional systems. By harnessing [[machine learning algorithms]] and [[Data analytics]], the proposed system offers a cost-effective and eco-friendly solution for energy management.



## Abstract

This project seeks to develop an AI-powered energy management system tailored for industrial and commercial facilities, with a central focus on optimizing energy consumption. In these contexts, energy expenditure is a major cost factor and a significant contributor to environmental pollution. The project addresses the challenge of limited visibility and control over energy use, often necessitating manual interventions with conventional systems. By harnessing machine learning algorithms and data analytics, the proposed system offers a cost-effective and eco-friendly solution for energy management.

The system collects real-time energy data from diverse sources, including sensors and meters, to forecast energy consumption patterns and detect opportunities for savings. Continuous analysis empowers the system to provide recommendations for energy-efficient practices and automate the control of energy-consuming devices, such as lighting and HVAC systems, for optimal energy utilization. Designed to be adaptable and scalable across various facility types, the system provides a user-friendly interface for facility managers and building owners, facilitating the monitoring and control of energy consumption. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with existing building automation systems, operating autonomously with minimal human intervention.

The envisioned outcome of this project is a solution that aids businesses in reducing energy costs, enhancing operational efficiency, and decreasing their environmental footprint through energy optimization. Benefits include cost savings, improved energy efficiency, a smaller carbon footprint, scalThe project is about building a device that can monitor as well possibly control the energy consumption of various devices in offices and industries in real-time.
